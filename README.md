Scheel Fund Website Project
Project Overview

The website aims to provide accessible information about the fund's mission, activities, and performance, as well as offer real-time financial data to its users. This platform is intended to boost community engagement and create an interactive online environment for current and prospective members of the Scheel Fund.
